Tony would be very proud of Gaga ü•π
This album to me is so calmingly eerie. It s almost like a fake smile. Pretending or at least trying to be happy even though you re mentally destroyed to the point you become manic
It's still hard to believe that we've gotten so much Gaga content this year
Fans latinoamericanos escuchando desde aqu√≠ porque no tenemos de otra todav√≠a jajajaja
I'm gonna listen to this every morning to start the day with happiness
This song exudes broadway. I hope we actually get a live theatrical of this movie!
Mexico loves you Mother monster Ô∏èüá≤üáΩ
VIBES OLD DISNEY
It‚Äôs official: The Queen of pop music is back!
theatrical queen
She's BACK!
"[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
Here we are together
I've loved you from afar
I've stayed up dreaming all night long
One day, you would have my heart
One day, she would have your heart

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Been up the whole night through
Good morning, good morning
To you
Good morning, good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning, good morning
To you





[Verse 1]
When the inmates began to sleep
The stars were shining bright
Now the warden's on his way
It's too late to say goodnight

[Chorus]
So good morning, good morning
Your problem soon smiles through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, morning
Good morning, good morning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Bang-bang, you're black and blue
Good morning, good morning to you
(Nothin' could be grander than to be in Louisiana)
In the morning, in the morning
You're back b–µhind the gate, good morning
Good morning to you
(It might be just a zippy if you was in Mississippi)
Wh–µn we left the movie show, the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn the show goes on, and I don't wanna say, ""Good night""
So say, ""Good morning, good morning""
Rainbows are shinin' through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you
Oh, good mornin', good mornin' to you (To you)"
What a classic Disney animation vibe 
I have 5 sons. The eldest is 30. I have sang good morning to my children for the last 30 years.  Watched Dinging in the Rain with my youngest (13) about a month ago to show him where I got it from. I LOVE this song. It is how my babies have start3d their day nigh on every day for 3 decades ‚ô°‚ô°
This is my new alarm clock.
"The movie is incredible, the acting beyond superb, the music left me speechless.  FANTASTIC Ô∏è"
Good Morning Mother ü´∂
I love it every time artists make a reference to Singin' in the Rain
enormous level of talent in this woman needs to be studied
This is my La la Land... I mean HA HA HA LAND
Like if you can‚Äôt wait for LG7

"The 1,000th comment just for me?! Well then...well...happy October Lady Gaga~~wish you many good mornings to you; my brother loved this song quite a bit so I'll be glad to share your version with him. And also, super proud of how far you've come and how far you seem like you're still going. Here's hoping to a thousand more blessings to come~"
"Twin sister and I might be turned 60 years old recently but one day we'll see our icon pretty soon!! UK Born even 
the wrong era even at our age black and white movies and music,  you'd definitely have a place in every era little Miss"
This song ganna be my new alarm

This is how my mornings will start sounding from now on. Love this!!
"I absolutely love this! I love show tunes, and her jazz and piano is my very favorite"
"Dude this is my new alarm, I'll wake up in such a good mood for collage (I've just begun)"
dejo mi huella (lo subio hace 14 min)
"I am here leaving a comment, so when someone

Those people who said she would never be famous must be reeling. Such incredible talent.
Just dropped another classic!!!!

BEST SONG

"Ojal√° que Lady Gaga venga alguna vez a Venezuela. Haria lo que sea sanamente por verla, desde que soy un ni√±o la amo. Me refugi√© en su m√∫sica en momentos muy dif√≠ciles para m√≠. Su m√∫sica, su estilo, su mensaje, su voz, ella simplemente es √∫nica.  Nunca olvidar√© c√≥mo gracias a Born this way mi autoestima mejor√≥.  Y hoy s√© que no hay algo mal en m√≠. Ha sido un camino dif√≠cil. Gracias por tanto arte."

Lets sing in the rain <3
"oh the gays are gonna love this

(its me I'm the gays)"
This song is so cute and cheering! Love it!
Sin duda una artista capaz de experimentar con diferentes facetas su vision
Michael Polansky is one the writer of this Song  I love it!
"If Lady Gaga could do Pop/Punk, Metal, Thrash Electronica and an Album in this style of Evanescence and Dance Pop Techno of the late 2000's, we could create a New Dance Pop Electronica style of Music for the 21st Century, Imagine Evanescence meets Zedd, Atari Teenage Riot and Lady Gaga with an Orchestra. European, Dance Techno Metal Electronica.  I'd call that a Perfect Formula for a New Genre of Music."
Sounds like a Christmas song
Bom dia! O sol j√° nasceu l√° na fazendinha
absolutely in love with this album
gagas coming for the EGOT !!!!!
Muy alegre la canci√≥n.....

"My favourite movie ever is Singin' in the Rain, so seeing this in the tracklist of Harlequin and hearing this version when it came out... gosh it brought me so much joy, and although I enjoyed (loved) the movie, I expected to hear this song but it wasn't in it, right? So I wonder... Maybe it was in a cut or dismissed scene? Or maybe just Gaga wanted to make her own version of the song inspired in the asylum and Lee? I'd love to know"
She really nails every music genre. Talent and beauty!!!
"10 minutes..!!
Yey, lady Gaga..!!"

Iconic as always
"It's the early 1950s, and Arthur Freed is looking for something to pour his 1920s-30s songwriters catalog into.  The end result sprung out on American theatergoers in 1952 as ""Singing in the Rain.""  This song, Good Morning, was sung by Debbie Reynolds, Donald O'Conner, and Gene Kelley.  It was a musical and cultural phenomenon at the time, and still plays well.  The film's premise concerns the time of transition in the late 1920s between silent films and the 'talkies.'  How appropriate Gaga would pick up this theme, as her catalog represents one transition in music to another.

Just like with Tony Bennett, she is able to capture the emotive sound of a bygone generation--and not just a blaise cover.  Oh, good stuff and the work of an artist.  Perhaps le chanteuse?

Here is a link to the original.  Performance art on the national level does not have anyone of this stature and ability these days.  We must look for the gems."
Omg it‚Äôs her version of the song from Singin‚Äô In The Rain!
Perfeitooooos
A masterpiece!!!

"@Lady Gaga it's a surprise album!!!!!!!!!! I loved it (not crazy for 1-2  songs only) and yesterday afternoon I ordered a red Vinyl plus the CD, besides ""Love for sale"" CD and ""Die with a smile"" Vinyl, but also the new album of Kylie!!!!! I can't wait to receive them and enjoy listening to them, in Greece!!!!! A fan from Athens Ô∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏èÔ∏è"

"Commenting after I listened to this entire album: Honestly, I freaking hope this movie gets really bloodier and crazier than I initially thought. Crude interpretative action scenes, either, would certainly portray as a fan-favorite. However, I'd rather like some lyrics of these as if the characters were snapping here and there again. With some twisty cruelty and some fancy wardrobe changes (absolutely not trendy nor any similar crap), but something meanly breathtaking ‚Äî but whatever anyway by now!!!!! Still ALSO do hope for a movie role where GaGa could get herself new possibilities to properly freak out on scene this time around!!!!! It's so promising when each and every new acting role leaves us merely dreaming on the brink of something stupendously to happen, but in the end directors seem to choose lesser from her and the characters. This woman has so much unused potential yet!!! Both physically and performatively!!!!! Not to forget her vocal interpretation as well!!! I have my rights of wanting to go GaGa for Lady Moonstruck on cinemas, too!!!! Haha"

"I noticed this cause I‚Äôm a nerd‚Ä¶ but Gaga naturally is left handed. In House of Gucci, to play Patrizia she used her right hand to write her number on the car windshield."

[Intro]
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm

[Verse 1]
Here we are together
I've loved you from afar
I've stayed up dreaming all night long
One day, you would have my heart
One day, she would have your heart

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Been up the whole night through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, good morning
It's great to stay up late
Good morning, good morning to you

[Verse 2]
When the inmates began to sleep
The stars were shining bright
Now the warden's on his way
It's too late to say goodnight

[Chorus]
So good morning, good morning
Your problem soon smiles through
Good morning, good morning to you
Good morning, morning
Good morning, good morning

[Instrumental Break]

[Chorus]
Good morning, good morning
Bang-bang, you're black and blue
Good morning, good morning to you
(Nothin' could be grander than to be in Louisiana)
In the morning, in the morning
You're back behind the gate, good morning
Good morning to you
(It might be just a zippy if you was in Mississippi)
When we left the movie show, the future wasn't bright
But came the dawn, the show goes on, and I don't wanna say, ""Good night""
So say, ""Good morning, good morning""
Rainbows are shinin' through
Good mornin', good mornin' to you
Oh, good mornin', good mornin' to you (To you)"
